# Multi Agent Pose Estimation
The code takes a video and adds pose information onto it. For best usage ensure that there aren't many people in the frame.

## Requirements
1. opencv (pip install opencv-contrib-python)
2. ffmpeg

## Usage
Place the video in question in the same folder and then:
1. Adjust the input name, length of video required in run.sh. Defaults to `dancing.mp4` and 30 seconds otherwise.
2. Run `bash run.sh`.
